### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Joonsu Heo
I'm studying at Kyunghee University majoring Software Convergence.
My dream is to be a quant, and currently studying various fields on quantiative finance.

**My main interest is:**
- Quantitative Finance
- Algorithmic Trading

Most of my projects were based on TA-based Algorithmic Trading referenced by books and lectures. 
Currently, I'm studying on Quantitative Finance to have a broader understanding of Financial engineering.

**My studying list at the moment:**
- Options, Futures and other derivatives
- Stochastic Calculus for Finance I, II
- Paul Wilmott on Quantiative Finance

**I'm currently working on (projects):**
- Predicting Option prices by using Monte-Carlo Simulation and compare accuracy using Black-Scholes model / Visualizing Option prices + implied volatility + 3d Vol surfaces to have an explicit understanding by actually implementing formulas that were only learned theoretically
- Building porfolio using deep-hedging techniques

**My future study & project ideas:**
- Finding alpha projects using pattern recognition
- Portfolio optimization / Asset Allocation
- Find arbitrage
